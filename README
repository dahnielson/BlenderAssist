BlenderAssist
=============

BlenderAssist is a collection of Python scripts that turn Blender into an 
Assistant Application for Lightworks (see p. 137 in the "Lightworks v11 
User Guide" for details).

Currently available scripts:

- BlenderCompAssist: Load the clips into the Blender compositor


Installation
------------

Preferable copy the BlenderAssist script files into the "~/Lightworks/
Effect Templates" directory in your user home directory. The scripts are
currently named with a .exe suffix despite being Python pure scripts, the
reason being a bug in Lightworks filtering of the file browser.

To add a BlenderAssist script, open the Effect dialog box in Lightworks,
select Assistant Application, click add and browse to the Effect Templates
directory, and add the script as executable.


Usage
-----

When using Blender as an Assistant Application it is possible to select a
.blend file to be loaded by using the Project File text box (see p. 139
in the "Lightworks v11 User Guide") in the configuration dialog.

Click the List Sources button in the configuration dialog to generate the
"~/sources-list.txt" file before launching Blender as Assistant Application.

To launch Blender as Assistant Application, click the Launch button in the
configuration dialog.
