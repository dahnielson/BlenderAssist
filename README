BlenderAssist
=============

BlenderAssist is a collection of Python scripts that turn Blender into an 
Assistant Application for Lightworks (see p. 137 in the "Lightworks v11 
User Guide" for details).[1]

Currently available scripts:

- BlenderCompAssist: Load clips from the edit into the Blender compositor 
                     and set up the correct duration, start and offset.


Installation
------------

Preferable copy the BlenderAssist script files into the "~/Lightworks/
Effect Templates" directory in your user home directory. Give the scripts
executable file permission.

N.B.: The scripts are currently named with a .exe suffix despite being Python 
pure scripts, the reason being a bug in Lightworks filtering of the file 
browser. [2] 

To add a BlenderAssist script, open the Effect dialog box in Lightworks,
select Assistant Application, click add and browse to the Effect Templates
directory, and add the script as executable.


Usage
-----

When using Blender as an Assistant Application it is possible to select a
.blend file to be loaded by using the Project File text box (see p. 139
in the "Lightworks v11 User Guide") in the configuration dialog.

Click the List Sources button in the configuration dialog to generate the
"~/sources-list.txt" file before launching Blender as Assistant Application.

To launch Blender as Assistant Application, click the Launch button in the
configuration dialog.
